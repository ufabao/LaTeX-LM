# minFalcon

This repository contains a small scale version (7M parameters) of the falcon model, which is currently the top model on the LLM leaderboard. This version is capable of being trained from scratch on my personal 1660 GPU. It currently has about 6 hours of training time, trained on the stacks project open source LaTeX source code with the goal of generating realistic looking mathematics.
